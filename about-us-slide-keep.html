        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <small></small>
        <p>
          Hi! I’m Bek, born and raised in Kyrgyzstan, a land of breathtaking
          mountains and rich nomadic culture. After dreaming of big cities as a
          child, I worked hard to earn a scholarship to study abroad, spending
          10 years in cities like Shanghai, Bangkok, and Taipei. Over time, I
          realized that nothing compares to the beauty of nature and my
          homeland. In Shanghai, I met my wife, Ruby, who is from Taiwan and
          shares my love for nature and simple living. Together, we set out on a
          mission to introduce Kyrgyzstan to the world.

        <p>
          Meeting Bek in Shanghai opened the door to Central Asia for me. I
          experienced so many firsts—riding a horse, staying in a yurt, hiking
          mountains, and soaking in hot springs. Bek, born in the land farthest
          from the sea, has always loved swimming and dreams of living on a
          tropical island.

        <p>
          When COVID struck, Bek found himself lonely and stranded in a foreign
          land. What was supposed to be a one-week trip to Thailand turned into
          two and a half years. It felt as though the world had left him behind,
          prompting him to rethink the meaning of life.

          After a year apart, Ruby went through great effort to prepare the
          necessary documents to come to Thailand. Bek proposed on the cliffs of
          Railay, one of the world's top rock climbing destinations—it seemed
          impossible to say no to this marriage!

          helped us discover the best and healthiest way of life!

          As the world began to recover, Taiwan remained closed. We returned to
          Kyrgyzstan to get married. Instead of hosting a banquet at a fancy
          hotel in the capital, we decided to overcome all obstacles and hold a
          traditional wedding full of memories in Beike's rural hometown where
          he was born!

          Our dream was to promote Kyrgyzstan, but at one point, we almost gave
          up and considered returning to our previous jobs. Then we realized
          that our friend Navat, who had been promoting Kyrgyzstan for years,
          was a beloved and passionate tour guide. We decided to join forces and
          became partners, founding a travel agency for Kyrgyzstan together.

        <p>
          When I was a child, I experienced two accidents that left me spending
          a long time in the hospital. It was then that I realized how short
          life is—we are not here on this Earth forever. I deeply cherish every
          moment I’ve had to explore the world since surviving those incidents.
          Don’t stop dreaming. Never stop chasing your dreams with all your
          heart. I am so grateful to be living in my dream right now!
